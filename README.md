## Git_Commands_In_Detail  
**To work on an up-to-date copy of the project, pull to get all the changes made by users**

git pull *REMOTE* *name-of-branch*  
git pull origin main  

**Create a new branch**  
git checkout -b *name-of-branch*

**Switch to a branch**    
git checkout *name-of-branch*    

**Publish local branch to your remote repository:**

## Setting_Up_GitHub_for_the_First_Time? 
First, make sure you set up a GitHub account and also downloaded Git to your computer    
*Do not use your personal GItHub account. Make a new one!*    

**To access the proxy reading the help file**   
git config â€“list   

**To link your GitHub account**     
git config --global user.name "your_username"   
git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com"

** You also need to access GitHub.com via a proxy. Note, this may not work in 2023 onwards***    
git config --global --replace-all http.proxy http:\domain.local\**PublixUsername*:*ComputerPassword*@webproxy1.publix.inet:9090

**Now that you machine is configured, follow these steps:**    
1. Change directory to where you want to maintain GitHub files      
For example: Set-Location *C:\Users\P1603119\Desktop\GitHub*   

2. Clone to that directory   
Example code:   
git clone https://github.com/GrossProfitSmart/GitSmart.git   
*(This will create a new folder in that directory which is where your git repository lives)*

3. Change directory again so you can start working in that repo!   
Example code:   
Set-Location *C:\Users\P1603119\Desktop\GitHub\GitSmart*
